City4CFD--*City for CFD*--is a tool that aims to automatically reconstruct high-detailed 3D city geometries tailored for microscale urban flow simulations.

It can automatically create a terrain from a point cloud and imprint different surfaces (e.g. green areas, water, roads).

It enables us to reconstruct buildings from different sources and their combination, such as:
  - Reconstruction with the combination of 2D polygons and a point cloud,
  - Extrusion of footprints containing height or floor number attributes,
  - The import of existing building models.

The reconstruction using the combination of point clouds and 2D polygons can be done in [LoD2.2, LoD1.3, and LoD1.2](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/lod/). You can use the [complexity factor](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City4CFD/wiki/Features#buildings) to tune the overall complexity of the reconstructed geometry. The LoD2.2 and LoD1.3 reconstructions are based on [roofer](https://github.com/3DBAG/roofer).

The resulting geometry is watertight -- buildings and surfaces are seamlessly integrated into a terrain.

It can automatically or manually define the zone of influence and domain boundaries.

If you happen to use it, feedback is very much appreciated.

City4CFD is developed by the [3D Geoinformation Research Group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) at the Delft University of Technology.

## Data formats
**Point clouds** can be imported in LAS/LAZ, TXT/XYZ, or PLY format. We ask separately for ground and building points. While some datasets contain building-ground classification, some do not. Our [point cloud preparation tool](https://github.com/ipadjen/City4CFD_doc/wiki/Point-clouds#automatic-preparation) can extract ground and building points from user-defined classes, or use the [Cloth Simulation Filter](http://ramm.bnu.edu.cn/projects/CSF/) to separate the ground and non-ground points. If you would like to check your points, see if they are classified, or even conduct the filtering and classification yourself, we suggest you use [CloudCompare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/).

**2D data** (polygons) are imported in [GDAL-supported formats](https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/index.html). For all pre-processing related to polygons you can use [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/).

**Geometry import** supports the following formats: OBJ, STL, PLY, OFF, VTP, and CityJSON.

**Output** is in the following formats: OBJ, STL, and CityJSON. The ID of each polygon is preserved, and there is a 1-to-1 mapping between the input and the output.

## Installation
You can directly compile City4CFD on your system using cmake, run it through a Docker container, or install using Homebrew in the case of macOS.

### Build from source
The following libraries are required to build the project:
- [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) >= 6.0.1
- Boost >= 1.66
- Eigen >= 3.3.4
- GMP >= 4.2
- MPFR >= 2.2.1
- GDAL >= 3.0

*OpenMP* is an optional dependency.

GMP, MFPR, and Eigen are necessary dependencies for CGAL.

Dependencies are generally available in Linux distributions, e.g. in Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:
```
sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libomp-dev libgdal-dev
```

CGAL can be directly downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/tag/v5.6.1) (-library). No install is necessary, only the path to the unzipped folder is required (see below).

In macOS you can install all dependencies with Homebrew:

```
brew install cmake boost cgal eigen libomp gdal
```

The project uses CMake to generate makefiles, so make sure it is also installed.

To build City4CFD, do the following:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCGAL_DIR=/path/to/cgal/dir
make
./city4cfd
```
In case of Homebrew, you do not have to use the ```-DCGAL_DIR``` parameter. You can speed up compilation by typing *make -j $numcores* where *$numcores* is the number of threads you can spare for compilation.

### Docker
We offer built [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images for every release, available at the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tudelft3d/city4cfd). Running [the docker script](https://github.com/tudelft3d/City4CFD/tree/main/docker/run) for the first time will pull the docker image from the Docker Hub repository.

### macOS
Mac users can install City4CFD through Homebrew:

```
brew install tudelft3d/software/city4cfd
```

## Getting started

The folder *examples* contains example datasets you can run for your first reconstruction. You can run your first reconstruction from the `/examples/TUD_Campus` folder by typing:
```
mkdir results
../../build/city4cfd config_bpg.json --output_dir results
```
in case of building from a source.

To run through a Docker container, you can use one of the scripts in ```docker/run/```. The script with the extension ```.sh``` can be used in Linux and macOS, the one with the extension ```.ps1``` in Windows Powershell, and the last one with ```.bat``` in Windows Command Prompt. You have to run  a script (you can copy it beforehand) from the root directory of the project (e.g. ```examples/TUD_Campus```), and the arguments are the same as for the compiled executable, e.g.: 

```
../../docker/run/city4cfd_run.sh city4cfd config_bpg.json --output_dir results
```

The script pulls the ```latest``` release from the Docker Hub. For a specific release, replace ```latest``` in the script with the released version tag, e.g. ```0.1.0```. In Linux systems, you will probably have to run the command as a sudo unless you create a 'docker' group and add users to it.

More information on the project can be found in the documentation.
