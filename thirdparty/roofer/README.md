# roofer - automatic building reconstruction from pointclouds

**roofer** performs fully automatic LoD2 building reconstruction from a pointcloud and a building roofprint polygon. It was originally developed, and is still used, to create the [3DBAG dataset](https://3dbag.nl). To use it, read [how to get started](https://3dbag.github.io/roofer/getting_started.html).

## Highlights

- It reconstructs a 3D building model from a pointcloud and a 2D roofprint polygon
- It is a fully automated process, there is no manual modelling required.
- It is possible to tweak the reconstruction parameters to adjust it to different input data qualities.
- It can output different Level of Details: LoD1.2, LoD1.3, LoD2.2. See [the refined Level of Details by the 3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/lod/).
- Usable either as a command line application or as a library with C++ and Python bindings.
- With the CLI application the building models are outputted to a [CityJSONSequence](https://www.cityjson.org/cityjsonseq/) file.

## Origin

The building reconstruction algorithms that underpin roofer were originally developed within the [3D geoinformation research group](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/) at the Technical University of Delft.
In 2022, the core developers of roofer founded [3DGI](https://3dgi.nl), a spin-off company from the same research group, and have continued the development of roofer through the company.

This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC):
- *2016-2022* under the European Unions Horizon2020 Research & Innovation Programme (grant agreement no. 677312 UMnD: Urban modelling in higher dimensions).
- *2022-2024* under the Horizon Europe Research & Innovation Programme (grant agreement no. 101068452 3DBAG: detailed 3D Building models Automatically Generated for very large areas).

In *2024-2026* this project has received funding from Kadaster, the Netherlands' Cadastre, Land Registry and Mapping Agency.

Prior to 2024 the building reconstruction algorithms were developed as part of *Geoflow* and the *gfp-building-reconstruction plugin*. During the summer of 2024 the code was refactored and the *roofer* project was born.

## Sponsorship

Software doesn't maintain itself. If you are a (professional) user of roofer and have an interest in ensuring that roofer is maintained, bugs are fixed and new features are added, consider supporting the project through sponsorship.

You can make one-off donations via [this link](https://bunq.me/fundroofer). If you would like to sponsor the roofer project in another way, or need an invoice, please reach out to us via [email](mailto:info@3dgi.nl).
